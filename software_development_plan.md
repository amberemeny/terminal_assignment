## User Stories
As a [user] I want to [action] so that I can [reason].

As a user I want to grow a virtual plant so that I can enjoy myself without growing a real plant.

As a user I want to take care of my virtual plant in a realistic sense so that it's like growing a real plant.

As a user I want to environment my plant is in to influence it's growth so that I can take care of my virtual plant realistically.

As a user I want my plant to be able die if I don't take care of it so I can be motivated to take care of my virtual plant properly.

## Purpose and Scope
The application I have chosen to develop is a plant simulation game created with the Ruby programming language. The program is designed to simulate the ecological growth stages of a potted sunflower plant. By implementing planned features, the user will be able to modify parameters that will then influence the increase or decrease of the plant's health and growth. Eventually, the plant will flower or die depending on how  well it is looked after.

Each iteration of the game will begin with a new day. After displaying the day number, the user will be able to water, fertilise, use pesticide on, and move the location of the plant. Multiple actions will be able to be preformed each day. By manipulating the variables  of the plant, the growth multiplier will then set the plant to grow at different speeds, encouraging the user to find the optimal conditions to grow their virtual plant. After the initial day, the application will display flavor text about any new growth and condition of the plant; if it has bugs or is looking too dry, for example.

The goal and condition to complete the game is to look after the plant well enough that it produces a flower. This is achieved by optimising the plants water level, intake of sunlight, location and fertiliser level. Upon winning or losing, the user will be able to exit the application or begin again.

The reason I am developing the Plant Sim application is to provide the user with the satisfaction of growing a flowering plant, without real-world time consumption or costs. My target audience for the project are mostly plant lovers, simulation game enthusiasts and teens/young adults. I am choosing to implement features that simulate a realistic difficulty in catering to a real plants needs. I believe that by doing so, I can provide an enjoyable alternative to taking care of a real plant.
